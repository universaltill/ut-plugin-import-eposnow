# Review — version-bump guard: a new repo's first PR (ut-docs#4484)

**Date:** 2026-10-16 · **Lane:** lane:cloud-24 · **Author model:** Opus 5.5 · **Reviewer:** Fable (independent subagent)

## What shipped

`scripts/check-version-bump.sh` gets the first-release block that is now
byte-identical in all 9 `ut-plugin-*` copies of the guard:

- manifest.json absent at the merge-base and present on main's tip → FAIL
  (a stale branch forked before the first manifest; rebase and bump);
- absent at the merge-base and at the head → pass (nothing releases yet);
- absent at the merge-base, present at the head → first release: the
  same-version comparison is skipped, the already-tagged check still runs;
- present at the merge-base but unparseable → still fails closed.

This repo's copy had a first-PR path (ut-docs#4430) that exited early, skipping the already-tagged check; it now keeps that check. New cases 23 (first version already tagged → FAIL) and 24 (no manifest at base or head → PASS); case 22 now asserts the stale-branch reason (it was masked by the already-tagged path).

No shipped file changed, so no manifest version bump.

## Verification

- `bash scripts/check-version-bump.test.sh` passes; `shellcheck` on both scripts: 0 issues.
- TDD: the new cases were run against the old script first and failed (red), then pass on the new one.
- The reviewer mutation-tested the block in scratch copies (drop the stale check, drop the head-absent check, early exit, the pre-fix parse error, drop the tag check): each mutation is caught by at least one case.

## Findings

| # | Severity | Finding | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | should-fix | eposnow case 22 asserted only `FAIL` and tagged v0.1.0, so the already-tagged path masked a deleted stale-branch check | Fixed: asserts `forked before manifest.json existed` (the mutation is now caught) |
| 2 | nit | the stale-branch case comment said main's manifest was "tagged"; the fixture deliberately isn't | Fixed: comment reworded |
| 3 | nit | the `first_release -eq 0 &&` gate is redundant (the sentinel can't equal a real version) | Accepted: explicit belt-and-braces |
| 4 | nit (pre-existing) | locally, BASE_SHA falls back to the merge-base, so the stale check is vacuous outside CI | Accepted: CI passes the real base sha; noted on ut-docs#4489 |
| 5 | info (pre-existing) | two concurrent first-release PRs both pass until one merges | Accepted: same race as any two version bumps |

## Verdict

Safe to merge. Deferred: one canonical copy + drift check — ut-docs#4489.
